      An increasing number of families are changing the way they holiday and
      finding new delight in vacation ownership, especially with the advantages
      it offers. Take Aarti and Rahul Bhalla, for example, a typical urban
      family with high pressure jobs and high expectations. “Club Mahindra
      Membership has actually changed the way we holiday”, says Rahul, a bank
      executive. Aarti, an independent management consultant, smiles. “To begin
      with, we actually take a family vacation every year. It's so much easier
      now - most of our holidays have already been paid for. All we need to do
      is choose the destination”. Club Mahindra Holidays - The fast growing
      holiday option! Club Mahindra Membership seems to be a tailor-made
      solution for today's time-poor, value-conscious consumers. Little wonder
      that it has gained more momentum in recent years. The All India Resort
      Development Association believe that timeshares and vacation ownerships
      are now 'perhaps the fastest growing segment' of the travel industry. With
      15-18 percent year-on-year growth, it's clear that vacation ownership
      resonates with the Indian consumer. According to Azoth Analytics research
      report, Global Vacation Ownership (Timeshare) Market is projected to
      display a robust growth represented by a CAGR of 7% during 2018 - 2023*.
      “It's easy to see why”, Rahul explains. “Your money works smarter and
      harder. You get a luxurious Club Mahindra Holiday at a fraction of the
      price. Imagine vacationing at some of the best resorts at some of the best
      locations in the world, without it denting your pocket. The best part is,
      there's something for everyone - kids, grandparents, and us”. Club
      Mahindra Membership Fees - Smart financial option! (Infographic depicting
      50%* savings on annual family holidays with a 25 year Club Mahindra Blue
      Season Studio Membership. ) (Infographic depicting 50%* savings on annual
      family holidays with a 25 year Club Mahindra Blue Season Studio
      Membership. ) Consider this, a couple and two kids head out for a
      week-long vacation every year. A hotel room in India would cost a minimum
      Rs 5,000/- a night, amounting to Rs 35,000/- every year for 7 nights. Over
      the next 25 years, that would equal Rs 8,75,500. Now, take inflation at 6
      per cent into account. The cost with inflation for your family vacation
      would be Rs 19,20,257. This means, the family would spend a whopping Rs 19
      lakhs over the next 25 years! Compare this with the 25 years Club Mahindra
      Membership for a Red Season Studio. The membership cost of approximately
      Rs 6 lakhs includes a 7N/8D vacation every year. Add in the Annual
      Subscription Fee (ASF) and your total costs including inflation; this
      would amount to approximately Rs. 12.5 lakhs - over 25 years! That's a
      significant saving of approximately 34% every year for 25 years. “And
      we're just talking about India here”, adds Aarti. “If one compares the
      cost of staying at hotels abroad, especially with fluctuating exchange
      rates, the math further favours vacation ownership. Plus, as bookings are
      made much in advance, this also gives us the benefit of competitive air
      fares and other travel costs”. Club Mahindra Membership - More value, more
      benefits! Rooms &amp; Amenities in Club Mahindra Resorts Rooms & Amenities
      in Club Mahindra Resorts A look at the Bhallas' Club Mahindra Membership
      clearly points at 'affordable luxury at its best!'' The resorts cater to
      members of all age groups and this is clearly evident in the physical
      design as well as other amenities. The rooms are larger than hotel rooms
      and spacious enough to accommodate a family of four. A typical hotel room
      in a 4-or 5-star hotel would measure 250 sq. feet upwards; whereas the
      base category room at a Club Mahindra Resort starts from 350 sq. ft.
      upwards. There is a further choice of studio apartments, 1 Bedroom, and 2
      Bedrooms, which offer bigger families or large groups the convenience of
      living under the same roof and bonding together. Three generations of the
      same family can easily live comfortably. One of the best features of the
      living spaces is that most of them include a dry kitchenette, which comes
      in handy especially for families with infants, young children and old
      parents. With over 2 decades of operations in India and around the world,
      Club Mahindra has its finger on the pulse of the preferences of the
      evolving Indian consumer. “There is also the added advantage of
      flexibility”, says Rahul. “Members can accumulate Club Mahindra Membership
      nights for up to 3 years and plan a longer domestic or international
      holiday of upto 14 nights”. For those of you who are new to the concept of
      vacation ownership, what is important to know is that Club Mahindra
      Holidays pays equal attention to the service standards as their resort
      location and amenities. In fact, the service would be on par with the
      standards of a star hotel. For instance, from the start to the end of your
      stay, you are attended to by a dedicated Host. Requests for specific
      requirements pertaining to travel, food, sightseeing and other interests
      are taken and arranged for even prior to your holiday. Here are a few
      other benefits of a Club Mahindra Membership: In-city Experiences: Club
      Mahindra has partnered with Dreamscapes, a website which curates unique
      and exciting experiences according to age and interests. “I didn't even
      know that microlight flying and hot air ballooning were available in
      India”, says an excited Aarti. “We choose the adventurous activities while
      Rahul's parents chose to go yachting and thoroughly loved the experience”.
      Dreamscapes offers over 400 interesting experiences and is accessible in
      15 cities as of now. Fun-filled Family Vacation at Club Mahindra Resorts

      offers exclusive discounts on spa treatments at Club Mahindra resorts.

      financial logic As Rahul explains, “I think the most important point is
      that the Club Mahindra resorts actually prompt you to do what every
      vacationer must do - relax! All their services and amenities focus on
      this. There is a dedicated host who attends to our every need. The
      children are well entertained at Happy Club, the kids' activity centre at
      Club Mahindra resorts, so Aarti and I actually have some time to
      ourselves. The property is a safe space and always buzzing with other
      families, so I don't have to worry about them. In fact, my kids are happy
      to get quality time with their grandparents - boating with them, playing
      board games. It's an amazing family bonding experience.” Club Mahindra
      Resort Activities Club Mahindra Resort Activities Aarti narrates her
      experience at Club Mahindra Kanha, “We truly had a memorable/ enjoyable
      time. While the morning yoga classes and spa sessions rejuvenated me, the
      kids discovered new creative skills and sportsmanship with activities like
      glass painting and cricket. The food was a delicious spread with a
      barbeque in the evening. But I'd say our most memorable experience was
      when we spotted a tiger on the safari”. Stay in an igloo in Manali, enjoy
      a forest picnic in the Himalayas, cycle around the quaint villages of Goa,
      lunch on a treehouse in Binsar, Visit the Santa Village in Finland…these
      are just some of the unique Club Mahindra experiences. Would the Bhallas
      recommend this to others? “Anytime,” smiles Aarti. “We've already
      recovered the cost of our Club Mahindra Membership Fees in just a few
      years. Financially smarter, resorts in some of the best places, with
      luxury for the adults and loads of activities for the kids? Is there any
      other option?” Such are the experiences shared by the Happy Members of
      Club Mahindra. The ideology of the Mahindra philosophy is deeply rooted in
      the values, vision and mission of Club Mahindra Holidays. By going beyond
      their core product to deliver unique and memorable experiences, they also
      deliver an unparalleled hospitality experience.
